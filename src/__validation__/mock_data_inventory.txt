# MOCK DATA INVENTORY/VALIDATION REPORT

## 1. Timeline Stats Tiles: `/components/timeline/TimelineView.tsx`
- [X] Line with mock stats:
  ```
  const timelineStats = {
    totalTasks: 47,
    onTrack: 32,
    atRisk: 12,
    delayed: 3,
    criticalPath: 8
  };
  ```
  **Status:**
  - STILL MOCK DATA – NOT dynamic. Should be derived from `useTasks()` and/or `useProjects()`.
  - These numbers are shown in the UI matching screenshot. NOT connected to Supabase.
- [X] Line with mock projects list:
  ```
  const projects = [
    { id: '1', name: 'Downtown Office Complex', progress: 65, status: 'active' },
    ...
  ]
  ```
  **Status:** 
  - STILL MOCK DATA. Should use `useProjects()` hook.

- [X] Line with mockTask for TaskDetails:
  ```
  const mockTask = { ... }
  ```
  **Status:** 
  - STILL MOCK DATA. Actual tasks should come from `useTasks()` and passed to the modal/details view.

---

## 2. Timeline Items: `/components/timeline/ProjectTimeline.tsx`
- [✓] Uses the `useTasks()` hook, and lists real Supabase data. **No mock arrays/tasks found.**
- [✓] Filtering by `projectId` from props/hook – correct.

---

## 3. Quick Stats Tiles: `/components/dashboard/QuickStats.tsx`
- [✓] The stats arrays all use calculated values:
  ```
  const activeProjects = projects.filter(...);
  const completedTasks = tasks.filter(...);
  ```
  - No mock data. **Correctly uses data from hooks.**

---

## 4. Reports: `/components/reports/ReportCharts.tsx`
- [✓] Uses the `useChartData` hook and reads live Supabase data. No mock/fake values.

---

## 5. Others
- Scanned "Planning" views, `MilestonePlanning`, etc. All appear to use correct hooks and not use fallback/mock data.
- Searched for numbers in mock tile ("47", "32", "8", etc.) – **No others found except those in TimelineView.**

---

# SUMMARY OF ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **`TimelineView.tsx`: All stats tiles and demo projects MUST use hooks**
    - Replace `timelineStats` with dynamic calculated values from `useTasks()` (for task progress/buckets)
    - Replace fake `projects` array with `useProjects()` from hooks
    - Replace `mockTask` with task selected from tasks array

2. **All other components validated as OK – already read from Supabase via hooks**

3. **Validation complete – referenced files/lines above**
