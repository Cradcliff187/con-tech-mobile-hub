**Status**: All migrations completed successfully. Tables enabled for real-time:
- projects, stakeholders, equipment, messages, documents
- resource_allocations, stakeholder_assignments, equipment_allocations
- maintenance_tasks, maintenance_schedules

### Phase 2: Improved Subscription Hooks âœ… COMPLETE

- [x] Create `useImprovedStakeholderAssignmentSubscription`
- [x] Create `useImprovedMaintenanceTaskSubscription`
- [x] Create `useImprovedEquipmentAllocationSubscription`
- [x] Create `useImprovedMaintenanceScheduleSubscription`
- [x] Create centralized `SubscriptionManager` service

**Status**: All 10 improved hooks created with proper TypeScript types and error handling.

### Phase 3: Update Existing Hooks âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Update `useProjects` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useStakeholders` with real-time subscription  
- [x] Update `useEquipment` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useMessages` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useResourceAllocations` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useStakeholderAssignments` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useMaintenanceTasks` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useDocuments` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useMaintenanceSchedules` with real-time subscription
- [x] Update `useEquipmentAllocations` with real-time subscription
- [x] Fix import issues and TypeScript errors

**Status**: All hooks successfully converted to real-time subscriptions. CRUD operations maintained, polling removed.

### Phase 4: Component Integration & Subscription Optimization âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Fix subscription loop issues causing "tried to subscribe multiple times" errors
- [x] Implement proper callback stability in hooks to prevent re-subscription loops  
- [x] Add subscription deduplication and rate limiting in SubscriptionManager
- [x] Enhance channel cleanup with proper debouncing (3 seconds)
- [x] Add circuit breaker pattern for failed subscriptions
- [x] Implement proper dependency management in subscription hooks
- [x] Add callback reference management to prevent unnecessary re-renders

**Status**: All subscription issues resolved. Real-time system fully operational.

### Phase 5: Production Cleanup & Hardening âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Remove all legacy polling code and `setInterval` monitoring
- [x] Remove redundant `refetch` functions that just logged messages
- [x] Clean up debugging console.log statements across all hooks
- [x] Standardize error handling and toast notifications
- [x] Remove development-only code and unnecessary timeouts
- [x] Optimize subscription management and cleanup operations
- [x] Ensure all hooks use centralized SubscriptionManager consistently

**Status**: Codebase fully cleaned and production-ready.

### Phase 6: Build Error Resolution & Final Verification âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Add backward-compatible `refetch` functions to maintain API compatibility
- [x] Complete assignment service with missing `deleteAssignment` and `bulkCreateAssignments` functions
- [x] Fix TypeScript type exports and compatibility issues
- [x] Resolve ReactNode type issues in components
- [x] Fix task type enum compatibility in subscriptions
- [x] Create proper type definitions and utility functions
- [x] Verify all build errors are resolved

**Status**: All build errors resolved. Application builds and runs without errors.

## Current Progress: ðŸŽ‰ 100% COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY

### Architecture Achievements:
1. **Centralized Subscription Management**: All subscriptions managed through `SubscriptionManager` singleton
2. **Automatic Deduplication**: Multiple components subscribing to same table share single channel
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Channels automatically cleaned up when no longer needed with 3-second debouncing
4. **Error Recovery**: Built-in reconnection capabilities for failed channels with circuit breaker protection
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents server overload (200ms minimum between calls)
6. **TypeScript Safety**: All hooks properly typed with comprehensive interfaces
7. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing hook interfaces maintained with `refetch` functions
8. **Subscription Loop Prevention**: Stable callback references prevent infinite re-subscription loops
9. **Dependency Optimization**: Hooks only re-subscribe when necessary (user ID or project ID changes)
10. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms
11. **Build Verification**: All TypeScript errors resolved, clean production build

### Production Features:
- **Performance**: Reduced network overhead through channel sharing and intelligent rate limiting
- **Reliability**: Automatic error recovery and reconnection with circuit breaker protection
- **Scalability**: Centralized management handles multiple subscriptions efficiently across all components
- **Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across all real-time hooks with clean, documented code
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Users see instant updates across all data types and views
- **Stability**: No subscription loops, duplicate channels, or memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper type exports and compatibility

### Code Quality:
- **Clean Codebase**: All legacy polling code removed, no redundant functions
- **Optimized Performance**: Removed debugging code, optimized callback handling
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized toast notifications and error recovery
- **Production Hardening**: Removed development-only code, optimized for production deployment
- **Build Stability**: All TypeScript errors resolved, clean compilation
- **API Compatibility**: Backward-compatible interfaces maintain existing component functionality
